<strong>
Chemistry:
</strong>
<br>
In Chemistry we have been learning about how the universe started basically "The Big Bang Theory". We did a group project all about how the universe started, in this project we talked about how we believe it started and its journey also writing about how different religions believe the earth started. The name of this project is called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHwkWYvuiEbfll6QaGzbr5NznbzVT54tKUFr77i-PgI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">"From stars to atoms"</a>
<br>
<br>
<strong>
World History:
</strong>
<br>
In World History we've been learning about a couple of revolutions, "The Haitian Revolution", "The French Revolution", & "The Latin American Revolutions". We just finished writing a DBQ about the 3 revolutions, in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z7QioS98jipP3ygUZrysLg2eorkhZWe1_dJjU-2Ugls/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">my DBQ</a> I wrote about the causes of each revolution and how they all ended.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>
English:
</strong>
<br>
In English we've been working on a three part writing project, this consists of an object from our past, our present and an object from our future. We had to write 3 different drafts, one for each object then for the final we're going to put them all together into one big writing. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Graphic Comms:
</strong>
<br>
In Graphic Comms we've been doing many different small projects that include intervewing, photography and photoshop. One of the big projects we're working on in class right now is the "Humans of DVC". Basically for this project we were assigned a partner and we had to interview them asking them certian qustions to make the conversation deeper between the two of us. After that we had to take a couple photos of our partner. Then we learned how to use pixlr, which is a cite that we use for photoshop. Using pixlr we needed to edit the photos and make them better then they already are.For the final product we're going to put 3 quotes from the intervew, a picture of our partner, and an artist statement about the picture and how we came to taking that picture. 
 Here are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t8dHu-GZxlbPKvYDV8FxTgQHNzPNJevf84S5G2q8fyk/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank">2 pictures<a/> from our photoshoot. 
<br>

<br>
In Algebra 2 we've been learning about different types of functions. This week we've been learning about domain and range. We've been working on a projec thats about creating a box with specific requirements by inputing equations into desmos using domain and range.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
CS:
</strong>
<br>
In CS we've been working on the project that were doing right now which is creating a website to showcase what've been doing in our classes for this semester. We took lessons on codecademy about HTML and CSS so that we know the basics in order to do this project.
